# Website Integrity & Uptime Monitoring Tool (Python Automation)
  This tool helps to check if websites are online (UP) or offline (DOWN). It also verifies if a specific keyword is present on the website to make sure the website content has not been changed or hacked.
# Technologies Used:
Python ‚Äì Programming language used to write the tool

Requests library ‚Äì To send HTTP requests to websites and get their content

File handling ‚Äì To save the check results into a text file

Basic string operations ‚Äì To search for keywords inside website content

# code
      import requests

      # 1. Get multiple websites and keyword from user
      websites = input("Enter websites (comma separated, like google.com, facebook.com): ")
      keyword = input("Enter keyword to search in websites: ")

     # 2. Split websites into a list
     website_list = websites.split(",")

     # 3. Set a simple output file name
     file_name = "website_result.txt"

     # 4. Open file to save results
     output_file = open(file_name, "w")

     # 5. Loop through each website
     for site in website_list:
          site = site.strip()  # Remove extra space

             if not site.startswith("http"):
                 site = "https://" + site  # Add https if missing

            try:
        response = requests.get(site, timeout=5)

        if response.status_code == 200:
            if keyword in response.text:
                result = f"‚úÖ {site} is UP and content is OK"
            else:
                result = f"‚ö†Ô∏è {site} is UP but keyword not found (Content changed)"
        else:
            result = f"‚ùå {site} is reachable but returned status code {response.status_code}"
    except:
        result = f"‚ùå {site} is DOWN or not reachable"

    # Show in terminal and save in file
    print(result)
    output_file.write(result + "\n")

# 6. Close the file
output_file.close()

print("\nüìÅ All results saved to website_result.txt")
